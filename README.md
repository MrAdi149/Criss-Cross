# Criss-Cross
         It is a game in which two player take turns in my game ‘O’ take the first turn then ‘X’ in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. 
         The winner is the  first player of the same symbols in a row and then the voice play like if X win the voice plays ”X jeet gya hai ” or if O 
         win the voice is like “O jeet gya hai”.
